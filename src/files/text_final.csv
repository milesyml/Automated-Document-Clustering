Ted Bundy,fr,"Ted Bundy, né Theodore Robert Cowell le 24 novembre 1946 à Burlington et mort le 24 janvier 1989 à Starke, en Floride, est un tueur en série américain. Il a agressé et assassiné de nombreuses jeunes femmes et filles durant les années 1970, et peut-être avant. En plus d'enlever et violer ses victimes, il a pratiqué des actes nécrophiles sur leur dépouille. En prison, après plus d’une décennie à nier les faits et peu de temps avant son exécution, il a admis avoir commis trente homicides dans sept États différents entre les années 1974 et 1978. Le nombre de victimes demeure inconnu, mais pourrait être beaucoup plus élevé.
Aux yeux de ses jeunes victimes féminines, Bundy apparaît comme un homme de belle apparence et charismatique, traits utilisés pour gagner leur confiance. De manière générale, il approche ses victimes dans des lieux publics, feignant une blessure ou un handicap, ou en se faisant passer pour une figure d’autorité, avant de les intimider et de les agresser dans un endroit plus isolé. Parfois, il a revisité ses scènes de crime pour y commettre des actes sexuels avec les corps en décomposition jusqu’à ce que la putréfaction et la destruction par les animaux sauvages rendent toute pratique impossible. Il a décapité au moins douze de ses victimes et gardé quelques-unes des têtes tranchées dans son appartement pour une certaine période de temps en guise de souvenir. À de rares occasions, il s’est introduit par effraction dans la maison de ses victimes au milieu de la nuit et les a tuées à coups de matraque durant leur sommeil.
Initialement incarcéré en Utah en 1975 sur des charges d'enlèvement qualifié et de tentatives d’agression criminelle, Ted Bundy est devenu suspect pour un nombre grandissant d'homicides non résolus dans plusieurs États américains. Accusé de meurtres au Colorado, il a organisé et réussi deux évasions spectaculaires.

Ted Bundy est mort sur la chaise électrique à la prison Raiford à Starke en Floride le 24 janvier 1989.
La biographe Ann Rule le décrit comme « un sociopathe sadique qui prenait plaisir dans la douleur d’autres êtres humains et le contrôle qu’il avait sur ses victimes, jusqu’à leur mort, et même après ». Un jour il se déclara « le plus grand fils de pute sans cœur que t'auras jamais rencontré »,, ce à quoi l’avocate Polly Nelson, membre de l’équipe s’occupant de sa défense, a consenti : « [Il] était la définition même d’un démon sans cœur ».",fr,"Ted Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell November 24, 1946 in Burlington and died January 24, 1989 in Starke, Florida, is an American serial killer.

Chernobyl disaster,en,"The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986, at the No. 4 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan.
The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor, which was commonly used throughout the Soviet Union. The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining cooling water circulation until the back-up generators could provide power – there is a time gap between the moment of power outage and the moment at which the back-up generators reach full power. This operating gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat. Three such tests had been conducted since 1982, but they had failed to provide a solution. On this fourth attempt, the test was delayed by 10 hours, so an unprepared operating shift had to perform it. During a gradual decrease of reactor power that was done in preparation for the test, the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level at one moment. The operators were able to partially restore power, but this put the reactor in a highly unstable condition. The risks were not made evident in the operating instructions, despite a similar accident occurring years before, and the test proceeded even though the power was still lower than prescribed. Upon test completion, the operators triggered a reactor shutdown, but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead.A large amount of energy was suddenly released, vapourising superheated cooling water and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive steam explosion. This was immediately followed by an open-air reactor core fire that released considerable airborne radioactive contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto parts of the USSR and western Europe, before being finally contained on 4 May 1986. The fire gradually released about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion. 
As a result of rising ambient radiation levels off-site, a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident. About 49,000 people were evacuated from the area, primarily from Pripyat. The exclusion zone was later increased to 30 kilometres (19 mi) radius when a further 68,000 people were evacuated from the wider area.The reactor explosion killed two of the reactor operating staff. In the emergency response that followed, 134 firemen and station staff were hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome due to absorbing high doses of ionizing radiation. Of these 134 people, 28 died in the days to months afterward and approximately 14 suspected radiation-induced cancer deaths followed within the next 10 years. Among the wider population, an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented as of 2011. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) has, at multiple times, reviewed all the published research on the incident and found that at present, fewer than 100 documented deaths are likely to be attributable to increased exposure to radiation. Determining the total eventual number of exposure related deaths is uncertain based on the linear no-threshold model, a contested statistical model, which has also been used in estimates of low level radon and air pollution exposure. Model predictions with the greatest confidence values of the eventual total death toll in the decades ahead from Chernobyl releases vary, from 4,000 fatalities when solely assessing the three most contaminated former Soviet states, to about 9,000 to 16,000 fatalities when assessing the total continent of Europe.To reduce the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protect it from weathering, the protective Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus was built by December 1986. It also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site, which continued operating. Due to the continued deterioration of the sarcophagus, it was further enclosed in 2017 by the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, a larger enclosure that allows the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris, while containing the radioactive hazard. Nuclear clean-up is scheduled for completion in 2065. The Chernobyl disaster is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties. The initial emergency response, together with later decontamination of the environment, ultimately involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion Soviet rubles—roughly US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation.

Lénine, située à l'époque en République socialiste soviétique d'Ukraine en URSS. Il s'agit de la plus grave catastrophe nucléaire du XXe siècle, classée au niveau 7, le plus élevé, de l'échelle internationale des événements nucléaires (INES), surpassant, d'après l'Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire (IRSN), par ses impacts environnementaux immédiats l’accident nucléaire de Fukushima de 2011, classé au même niveau. L’IRSN mentionne pour ces accidents des effets sanitaires potentiels, une contamination durable de territoires et d’importantes conséquences économiques et sociales.
L'accident a été provoqué par l'augmentation incontrôlée de la puissance du réacteur no 4 conduisant à la fusion du cœur. Cela a entraîné le craquage de l'eau des circuits de refroidissement conduisant par la suite à une explosion et la libération d'importantes quantités d’éléments radioactifs dans l’atmosphère, provoquant une très large contamination de l'environnement, et de nombreux décès et maladies survenus immédiatement ou à long terme du fait des irradiations ou contaminations.

 
Les conséquences sanitaires de la catastrophe de Tchernobyl, controversées, sont importantes aussi bien sur le plan sanitaire, écologique, économique que politique. Plus de 200 000 personnes ont été définitivement évacuées. Le nombre de morts directement liés à la catastrophe, objet de controverses, varie selon les sources de 200 (décès d'origine radiologique avérés officiellement constatés par les Nations unies) à un peu moins d'un million. En 2016, l’Ukraine a formellement reconnu 35 000 décès directement liés à Tchernobyl. D'autres estimations font état de 150 000 « liquidateurs » morts sur les 350 000 d’Ukraine,.

IRSN mentions for these accidents potential health effects lasting contamination of territories and significant economic and social consequences.
The accident was caused by the uncontrolled increase in reactor power No. 4 leading to the merger of the heart. This led to the cracking of the water cooling systems, leading eventually to an explosion and release large amounts of radioactive elements in the atmosphere, causing extensive environmental contamination, and many deaths and diseases occurring immediately or in the long term because of radiation or contamination.

 
The health consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, controversial, are important both in terms of health, ecological, economic and political. More than 200 000 people were permanently evacuated. The number of deaths directly related to the disaster, controversial, depending on the sources of 200 (deaths proven to radiation officially recognized by the UN) to just under a million.

Chernobyl disaster,zh,"切尔诺贝利核事故（俄語：Авария на Чернобыльской АЭС，烏克蘭語：Чорнобильська катастрофа，英語：Chernobyl disaster），或簡稱車諾比事件，又譯 切爾諾貝爾核事故，是1986年4月26日於苏联烏克蘭普里皮亞季市切爾諾貝爾核電站发生的核反应堆破裂事故。該事故是歷史上最嚴重的核電事故，也是首例被國際核事件分級表評為最高第七級事件的特大事故。事故的主因為反應爐进行紧急停机后的後備供電測試时，因操作人員的訓練不足，最终使功率急剧增加，破坏反应堆。与早期各国核反应堆类似，RBMK-1000缺乏严重意外下的多重防护措施，設計缺陷使大量的輻射物質被釋放到環境中。最初发生的蒸氣爆炸導致兩人死亡，往後絕大部分受害者的病因及死因都歸咎於事故中釋放的高能輻射，然而輻射塵少量放射導致的影響依舊爭論不休。在苏联建成使用的与切尔诺贝利4号机组同型號的15座RBMK-1000反应堆中，除切尔诺贝利的4座于2000年前被相继关闭外，其余11座均运行至今，预计在2019年后逐步关闭。
1986年4月26日凌晨1時23分47秒（UTC+3），乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国普里皮亚季鄰近的車諾比核電廠的第四號反應爐發生爆炸。連續的爆炸引发大火並釋放大量高能量輻射物質到大氣層，這些輻射性塵埃覆蓋了大面积區域。這次災難所釋放出的輻射劑量是二戰時期廣島原子彈爆炸的400倍以上。被核輻射塵污染的雲層飄往众多地区，包括前蘇聯西部的部分地區、西歐、東歐、斯堪地那維亞半島、不列顛群島和北美東部部分地區。此外，烏克蘭、白俄羅斯及俄羅斯境內均受到嚴重的核污染，超過336,000名的居民被迫撤離。前蘇聯官方的報告表示，約60%受到輻射塵污染的地區皆位於白俄罗斯境內。經濟上，這場災難總共损失大概两千亿美元（已计算通货膨胀），是近代歷史中代價最大的災難。這次意外引起了全世界對於蘇聯核電工業上的安全顧慮，并減緩了一系列的核電工程進度。同時，此事件令蘇聯政府的訊息公佈更趨透明化。蘇聯解體後的獨聯體及各獨立國家，包括俄羅斯、烏克蘭、白俄羅斯，至今仍為切尔诺贝利事件所遺留下來的污染問題付出極大的代價，以切尔诺贝利核电站为中心半径30公里内的大片乌克兰和白俄罗斯领土至今仍被两国政府列为管制区。此次事故對當地乃至全球生態造成了難以想像的負面影響，僅事件所造成的死亡人數就因多種原因難以精確計算，其中前蘇聯時期的刻意隱瞞，使得統計工作變得非常困難。事實上，前蘇聯當局在事件發生後不久，就禁止醫生在死亡證明文件上提及「放射线」的死因事實。
由國際原子能總署和世界衛生組織所主導的切尔诺贝利论坛在2005年所提出的車諾比事件報告中，共56人死亡（47名救災人員，9名罹患甲狀腺癌的兒童），並估算暴露在高度輻射物質下的大約60萬人中，將額外有4,000人將死於癌症。此数据包括已診斷出的4,000名兒童甲狀腺癌將造成的死亡數字（依據白俄羅斯的經驗，此癌存活率接近99%）。綠色和平組織所估計的總傷亡人數是93,000人，但引用在一份最新出爐的報告中的數據指出發生在白俄羅斯、俄羅斯及烏克蘭單獨事件在1990年到2004年間可能已經造成20萬起的額外死亡，但此數字來源並非來自經過同儕審查的學術論文。儘管疏散區域和某些限制地區還有些管制，但是大多數的受影響區域已經被認為可以安全地居住和進行經濟活動，針對此地附近的廢棄都市進行「輻射觀光」的金額還在逐步成長。",zh-CN,"切尔诺贝利 nuclear accident (Russian: Авария на Чернобыльской АЭС, Ukrainian: Чорнобильська катастрофа, English: Chernobyl disaster), or simply Chernobyl, also translated the Chernobyl nuclear accident, is April 26, 1986 nuclear reactor in the Soviet Union 乌克兰普里皮 Aki Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the city of rupture accident.

Contaminated by fallout of nuclear cloud drifted many areas, including parts of western former Soviet Union, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Scandinavian Peninsula, the British Isles and parts of eastern North America. In addition, Ukraine, Belarus and in Russia are subject to serious nuclear pollution, more than 336,000 residents were forced to evacuate. The official report of the former Soviet Union, said about 60% by radioactive fallout contaminated areas are located in the territory of Belarus. Economically, the disaster lost a total of about two hundred billion dollars (calculated inflation), is the most costly in the history of the modern disaster. The accident caused a worldwide concern for the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry, and slow down the progress of a series of nuclear power engineering.

Donald Trump,fr,"Donald John Trump [ˈdɒnəld d͡ʒɑn tɹʌmp], né le 14 juin 1946 à New York, est un homme d'affaires, animateur de télévision et homme d'État américain, président des États-Unis depuis le 20 janvier 2017.
Fils du promoteur immobilier Fred Trump, il travaille dans l'entreprise de son père pendant ses études à l’école de commerce de Wharton. Il prend en 1971 la tête de l'entreprise familiale, qu'il renomme The Trump Organization.
À partir des années 1970, il se constitue un empire immobilier et une notoriété grâce à des bâtiments prestigieux qui portent généralement son nom. Une partie de ses immeubles — dont plusieurs gratte-ciel, parmi lesquels la Trump Tower — se trouvent dans l'État de New York, mais il en possède également dans d'autres pays. Propriétaire de casinos, de résidences de luxe et de terrains de golf, il réalise par ailleurs de nombreux investissements dans divers domaines (sports, médias et concours de beauté notamment). Célébrité médiatique aux États-Unis dès les années 1980, impliqué dans le secteur du divertissement télévisuel, il est de 2004 à 2015 l'animateur de l'émission de téléréalité The Apprentice.
Il entre en politique dans les années 1980, et s'affilie alternativement au Parti démocrate, au Parti républicain et au Parti de la réforme, dont il brigue l'investiture pour la présidentielle de 2000 avant de renoncer. Opposé à la guerre d'Irak et au président au président George W. Bush, il est à nouveau affilié au Parti républicain à partir de 2012. Il critique la politique du président démocrate Barack Obama, dont il met en doute la citoyenneté américaine pendant plusieurs années.
Candidat aux primaires républicaines de 2016, il voit sa personne et son discours cristalliser d’importantes oppositions ; mais malgré l'hostilité de l'appareil républicain, il remporte les primaires du parti. Il mène une campagne atypique en s'appuyant sur une équipe réduite et en développant un usage intensif des réseaux sociaux. Se présentant comme un adversaire de l'establishment et du politiquement correct, il emploie un ton belliqueux, multiplie les contrevérités et les déclarations controversées, en particulier avec des propositions radicales visant à réduire l'immigration. Les observateurs qualifient généralement son discours de populiste, nationaliste, protectionniste et climato-sceptique.
Lors de l'élection présidentielle de 2016, sa victoire face à la démocrate Hillary Clinton déjoue la plupart des pronostics. Lors de sa prise de fonction, il devient le président américain le plus âgé et le plus riche de l'histoire, le premier à n'avoir jamais exercé précédemment de fonction politique ou militaire, ainsi que le cinquième à avoir gagné l'élection présidentielle américaine tout en étant devancé dans le vote populaire.
Pendant son mandat, il signe des décrets restreignant l'immigration — notamment issue de pays musulmans —, procède à une extension du mur à la frontière entre les États-Unis et le Mexique, retire son pays de l’accord de Paris sur le climat et de celui sur le nucléaire iranien, reconnaît Jérusalem comme capitale d'Israël, procède au retrait des troupes américaines de Syrie et rétablit les relations avec la Corée du Nord.

Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format.
The band's 1977 album News of the World contained ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We Are the Champions"", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. ""Another One Bites the Dust"" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia - a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the ""Queen +"" name with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.
Estimates of Queen's record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the British Phonographic Industry. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.

Three of the victims were black or Latino. Meili was so badly injured that she was in a coma for 12 days. The New York Times in 1990 described the attack on her as ""one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980s"".Attacks in Central Park that night were allegedly committed by a loose group of 30–32 teenagers, and police attempted to apprehend suspects after crimes began to be reported between 9 and 10 p.m. The brutally beaten Meili was not found until 1:30 a.m., after which the police hunt greatly intensified. They took into custody 14 or more other suspects over the next few days and arrested a total of ten suspects who were ultimately tried for the attacks. Among them were four African American and two Hispanic American teenagers who were indicted on May 10 on charges of assault, robbery, riot, rape, sexual abuse, and attempted murder of Meili and an unrelated man, John Loughlin. The prosecutor planned to try the defendants in two groups, then scheduled the sixth defendant to be tried last. The latter pleaded guilty in January 1991 on lesser charges and received a reduced sentence.
Prosecution of the five remaining defendants in the rape and assault case was based primarily on confessions which they had made after police interrogations. None had counsel during this questioning. Within weeks, they each withdrew these confessions, pleaded not guilty, and refused plea deals on the rape and assault charges.

No substantive physical evidence connected any of the five teenagers to the rape scene, but each was convicted in 1990 of related assault and other charges. Subsequently, known as the Central Park Five, they received sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years. Four of the defendants appealed their convictions, but these were affirmed by appellate courts. The four juvenile defendants served 6–7 years each; the 16-year-old was tried and sentenced as an adult and served 13 years in an adult prison.

Machine learning,fr,"L'apprentissage automatique, (en anglais : machine learning, litt. « apprentissage machine, »), apprentissage artificiel ou apprentissage statistique est un  champ d'étude de l'intelligence artificielle qui se fonde sur des approches mathématiques et statistiques pour donner aux ordinateurs la capacité d' « apprendre » à partir de données, c'est-à-dire d'améliorer leurs performances à résoudre des tâches sans être explicitement programmés pour chacune. Plus largement, il concerne la conception, l'analyse, l'optimisation, le développement et l'implémentation de telles méthodes.
L'apprentissage automatique comporte généralement deux phases. La première consiste à estimer un modèle à partir de données, appelées observations, qui sont disponibles et en nombre fini, lors de la phase de conception du système. L'estimation du modèle consiste à résoudre une tâche pratique, telle que traduire un discours, estimer une densité de probabilité, reconnaître la présence d'un chat dans une photographie ou participer à la conduite d'un véhicule autonome. Cette phase dite « d'apprentissage » ou « d'entraînement » est généralement réalisée préalablement à l'utilisation pratique du modèle. La seconde phase correspond à la mise en production : le modèle étant déterminé, de nouvelles données peuvent alors être soumises afin d'obtenir le résultat correspondant à la tâche souhaitée. En pratique, certains systèmes peuvent poursuivre leur apprentissage une fois en production, pour peu qu'ils aient un moyen d'obtenir un retour sur la qualité des résultats produits.
Selon les informations disponibles durant la phase d'apprentissage, l'apprentissage est qualifié de différentes manières. Si les données sont étiquetées (c'est-à-dire que la réponse à la tâche est connue pour ces données), il s'agit d'un apprentissage supervisé. On parle de classification ou de classement si les étiquettes sont discrètes, ou de régression si elles sont continues. Si le modèle est appris de manière incrémentale en fonction d'une récompense reçue par le programme pour chacune des actions entreprises, on parle d'apprentissage par renforcement. Dans le cas le plus général, sans étiquette, on cherche à déterminer la structure sous-jacente des données (qui peuvent être une densité de probabilité) et il s'agit alors d'apprentissage non supervisé. L'apprentissage automatique peut être appliqué à différents types de données, tels des graphes, des arbres, des courbes, ou plus simplement des vecteurs de caractéristiques, qui peuvent être continues ou discrètes.",fr,"Machine learning, (in English:. Machine learning, literally ""learning machine""), machine learning or statistical learning is a field of study of artificial intelligence that is based on mathematical and statistical approaches to give computer the ability to ""learn"" from the data, that is to say, to improve their performance in solving tasks without being explicitly programmed for each. More broadly, the design, analysis, optimization, development and implementation of such methods.
Machine learning typically involves two phases. The first is to estimate a model from data, called comments, which are available and finite in number during the system design phase. The estimated model is to solve a practical task, such as translating a speech estimate a probability density, recognize the presence of a cat in a photograph or participate in the conduct of an autonomous vehicle. This phase called ""learning"" or ""training"" is usually carried out prior to the practical use of the model. The second phase corresponds to the start of production, the model being determined, new data can then be subjected in order to obtain the result for the desired task. In practice, some systems can continue learning once in production, if they have a way to get a return on product quality results.
According to available information during the learning phase, learning is described in different ways. If the data are labeled (that is to say that the answer to the task is known for such data), it is a supervised learning. We speak of classification or ranking if the labels are discrete, or regression if they are continuous. If the model is learned incrementally based on a reward received by the program for each of the actions, it is called reinforcement learning. In the most general case, without labels, we seek to determine the underlying data structure (which can be a probability density) and then is unsupervised learning. Machine learning can be applied to different types of data, such as graphs, trees, curves, or simply feature vectors, which can be continuous or discrete.",5

Singapore,en,"Singapore ( (listen)), officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign city-state and island country located in maritime Southeast Asia. Singapore lies about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, and, by extension, the southernmost extremity of continental Eurasia. The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia's Riau Islands, its northern, western, and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia, and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east. It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east. The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet, the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects.
Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Malay Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history, modern Singapore, then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate, was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles, a British colonial officer, established a trading post of the East India Company on the main island. In 1824, the main island and its satellite islands were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate, and in 1826, Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements, a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula. From 1830 to 1858, the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company's Bengal Presidency; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj. In 1867, Britain's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India, and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London, bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony.From 1867 to the 1940s, Singapore grew into a successful entrepôt that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond. During the Second World War, Imperial Japan successfully invaded and annexed Singapore, resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief but violent Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945. Following Japan's surrender in 1945, Singapore was returned to British control; in 1946, the Straits Settlements were dissolved, and Singapore became a standalone crown colony. In 1959, following a protracted period of agitation against colonial rule, Singapore gained limited autonomy from the British Empire. In 1963, Singapore became fully emancipated from colonial rule after it federated with the territories of the erstwhile British Malaya and British Borneo to form the country of Malaysia, but after two tumultuous years as a constituent state of the Malaysian Federation, and following intractable differences, Singapore was expelled in 1965, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will—though this narrative remains highly contentious.  After early years of turbulence, the newly sovereign nation—viewed as a nonviable state by international observers due to its diminutiveness, geostrategic vulnerability, absence of natural resources, and lack of a hinterland—defied odds by rapidly developing and industrialising under the leadership of the founding People's Action Party to become a high-income economy and developed country within a single generation.

As a legacy of its historical nature as an entrepôt, modern Singapore is a pluralistic country with a racially, culturally, and religiously diverse citizenry, with one indigenous ethnic group, the Malays, and two settler-descended ethnic groups, the Chinese and Indians, forming the historical and contemporary core of the country's citizen populace.

Sa superficie est de 719,1 km2. Elle comprend 63 îles, dont la principale est Pulau Ujong (584,8 km2). Cette île est très densément urbanisée, mais la végétation luxuriante – même en plein centre-ville – a valu à Singapour le surnom de « ville jardin ». Cette abondance de verdure découle en partie d'un climat équatorial, uniformément chaud et orageux tout au long de l'année. Sa densité de population est la plus élevée d'Asie et la deuxième sur le plan mondial.
L'État de Singapour est situé à l'extrême sud de la péninsule Malaise, dont il est séparé au nord par le détroit de Johor, et borde au sud le détroit de Singapour. Il est connu et souvent montré en exemple pour son extraordinaire réussite économique. Après l'indépendance de l'Empire britannique en 1958, le rattachement à la Malaisie en 1963, puis l'indépendance en 1965, Singapour a su devenir, avec très peu de ressources naturelles et des problèmes socio-économiques importants – émeutes raciales, chômage massif, difficultés de logement et d'accès à l'eau –, l'un des pays les plus développés et les plus prospères du monde, en termes d'économie, d'éducation, de santé, de sécurité et d'urbanisme. La ville, cité souveraine, est un réduit chinois au cœur même du monde malais : la population est majoritairement composée de Chinois (74,3 %). De cette confrontation ethnique sont nés en partie les troubles qui ont accéléré son retrait de la Malaisie, le 9 août 1965.
Dans les années 1980, le pays fait partie, avec Hong Kong, la Corée du Sud et Taïwan, des quatre dragons asiatiques, des États en transition et au développement économique effréné. En 2011, Singapour est le troisième pays au monde en termes de produit intérieur brut à parité de pouvoir d'achat (PPA) par habitant après le Qatar et le Luxembourg. Plaque tournante commerciale et financière entre la zone Pacifique et l'Europe, la ville doit son essor à sa situation maritime exceptionnelle à l'extrémité Est du détroit de Malacca, qui lui vaut le surnom de : « Cité marchande aux confins de l'Orient ». Elle possède le deuxième port au monde (après Shanghai) en termes d'exportations et de trafic maritime. La population singapourienne dispose d'un très haut niveau de vie et la Cité-État est souvent surnommée « La Suisse d'Asie ».

Its area is 719.1 km2. It comprises 63 islands, the main one being Pulau Ujong (584.8 km2). This island is densely urbanized, but lush - even in the downtown - Singapore earned the nickname of ""garden city"". This abundance of greenery stems in part from an equatorial climate, hot and stormy evenly throughout the year. Its population density is highest in Asia and the second globally.
The government of Singapore is located in the extreme south of the peninsula Malaysia, which it is separated on the north by the Straits of Johor and south borders the Straits of Singapore. It is known and often exemplified for its extraordinary economic success. After independence from the British Empire in 1958, the union with Malaysia in 1963 and independence in 1965, Singapore has managed to become, with very few natural resources and important socio-economic issues - race riots, unemployment massive, housing problems and access to water - one of the most developed and prosperous countries in the world in terms of economy, education, health, security and urban planning. The sovereign city, is a Chinese cut to the heart of the Malay world: the population is mainly composed of Chinese (74.3%). This ethnic confrontation were born in part the troubles that have accelerated its withdrawal from Malaysia, August 9, 1965.
In the 1980s, the country belongs to, with Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, the four Asian dragons, transition states and rampant economic development. In 2011, Singapore is the third country in the world in terms of gross domestic product at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita after Qatar and Luxembourg. commercial and financial hub between the Pacific and Europe, the city owes its growth to its unique maritime location at the eastern end of the Strait of Malacca, which earned him the nickname ""Merchant City on the border of the East "". It has the second largest port in the world (after Shanghai) in terms of exports and maritime traffic. Singapore's population has a very high standard of living and the city-state is often called ""Switzerland of Asia"". In 2009, Singapore and had the highest concentration of millionaires relative to the total population ahead of Hong Kong (China), Switzerland, Qatar and Kuwait.
Featuring a remarkable political stability, Singapore is now considered an ""authoritarian democracy"" or ""benevolent dictatorship"", with the same family in power since independence. The city-state is regarded as a country practicing economic liberalism without political liberalism.
The center is located in the south of the island of Pulau Ujong, at the mouth of the Singapore River (Singapore River).
